# DMS-toggle

DMS-toggle is a plugin for exiled 9.1.1 that disables **Deadman's Switch** for 1 round, this is convenient if you have a server with normal rounds where you want it to be active, but you want to disable it for 1 round to do an event round or something like that.


**Command:** ` togglewarhead `
**For: `Exiled 9.1.1`**
